**Note: this release has a breaking change (which is, however, easy to fix)**

Changed package structure: the flupke package (and all subpackages) now start with `tech.kwik.flupke`.

**Upgrade instructions:** perform a global find-and-replace to replace the string `net.luminis.http3` by `tech.kwik.flupke`.
If your project is also using the android drop-in replacement for the Java HTTP Client, also replace the string `net.luminis.httpclient` by `tech.kwik.flupke.httpclient`.
